# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Terraform module to manage [AWS Service Quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/intro.html).

# Introduction to the project
# introduction: |-
#   This is an introduction.

# How to use this module. Should be an easy example to copy and paste.
usage: |-
  For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

  For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)
  (which tests and deploys the example on AWS), see [test](test).

  `NOTE:` Some service quotas can only be managed from specific regions (see [hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws#13075](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/issues/13075))

  ```hcl

    # version = "x.x.x"

  }

  locals {
    service_quotas = [
      {

        service_code = "vpc"
